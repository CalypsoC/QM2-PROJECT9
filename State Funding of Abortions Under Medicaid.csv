"Notes"
"The federal Hyde Amendment, passed in 1977, bans state use of federal Medicaid dollars to pay for abortions unless the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest, or the abortion is ""necessary to save the life of the woman."" States can use their own funds to cover other medically necessary abortions - usually defined by states as those to protect the physical or mental health of the woman - for Medicaid beneficiaries. Overall, 34 states and DC follow the Hyde amendment standards, 1 state, South Dakota, does not follow Hyde standards and only pays for abortions when necessary to protect a woman's life, while 15 states pay for all or other medically necessary abortions. "

"On June 24, 2022, the Supreme Court overturned  Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal standard protecting the right to abortion and returning the regulation of abortion to the states. A number of states have laws banning abortions that predate the Roe v. Wade decision but it is unclear whether they are now in effect. Some states enacted laws after the Roe ruling that ban abortions and were designed to be ""triggered"" and take effect automatically once Roe was overturned. Other states have enacted laws that would [protect](https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/issue-brief/state-actions-to-protect-and-expand-access-to-abortion-services/) access to abortion. (As of July 7, 2022)."
