Age 
Our data is from the United States Census Bureau based on the 2016-2020 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.  


Abortion strictness 
We transcribe the interactive map from the Guttmacher institute on U.S Abortion Policies and Access after Roe. Since the legality of abortion was left to individual states, the organisation use a range of policies to assess the strictness of abortion law in each state. This includes gestational age bans, waiting periods and more policies from the side of Restricting the right to abortion and policies like state constitutional protections, abortion funding etc. Then the researchers assigned one of seven categories to each state, based on these policies related to abortion rights and access. From extremely restrictive to most protective, we manually score them from one to seven for the later data analysis. This data was transcribed by the end of October 2022, any policy changes after that will not be reflected. 
Access to funding for abortions 2022 
We extract this dataset from the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), a non-profit organization focusing on national health issues in the U.S. They transcribe the summary table from the Guttmacher institute on state funding of abortion under Medicaid.

Median Household Income
This piece of data comes from the United States Census Bureau based on the 2021 American Community Survey 1-Year Estimates. Similar to other datasets from this database, it directly describes median income in the past 12 months with adjustment on 2021 inflation. As the margin of error for median income is smaller than mean income, we choose to use median household income. 


Political  affiliation 2021 
This dataset comes from FiveThirtyEight’s partisan lean metric. The data shows the relative partisanship of a state or district. Therefore, they defined “partisan lean” as the average margin difference between how a state or district votes in a given national environment. The calculation method is that they take into account of 50 percent how the state or district’s vote compares to the nation in the most recent presidential election, 25 percent of its relative lean in the second-most-recent presidential election and 25 percent a custom state-legislative lean based on the statewide popular vote in the four most recent state House elections or lower-chamber equivalent for some states. 


Education 
This dataset is extracted from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Economic Research Services. The data for 2020 is a 5-year average from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey. In order to investigate the relationship between the level of education and the strictness of abortion in each state. We choose to use college (those who received a bachelor's or higher degree.) completion rates for the population 25 years and over and the percentage of the population 25 years and over who completed high school only. 


Religious affiliation
According to our literature review, religiosity has an influence on people’s attitudes towards abortion. As religious affiliation is hard to quantify. We used a study from the Pew Research Center called The 2014 U.S. Religious Landscape Study. From this report, researchers completed telephone interviews with more than 35,000 Americans across the country. 
Based on our hypothesis, we focused on two measures from this research the Religiosity Index and attendance at religious services by state. We looked at the percentage of people who say they attend religious services at least once a week for each state. Similarly, we looked at the percentage of respondents who score high on the scale of the Religiosity Index. 
More explanation on Religiosity Index: 


The index is created by the Pew Research Center. It combines four individual measures, which are self-assessment of religion’s importance in one’s life, religious attendance, frequency of prayer, and belief in God. Then, respondents got a score for each measure. If the sum of scores is greater or equal to two then the respondents are categorised as “high” on the scale. 


A score of 1 for each of the four measures means : 
religion is very important in one’s life, attending religious services weekly or more, praying at least once a day, and believing in God with absolute certainty. 
A score of 0 for each of the four measures means: 
respondents declined to answer one of the questions, saying religion is somewhat important in one's life, attending religious services monthly or yearly, praying between a few times a week and a few times a month, and believing in God with less than absolute certainty. 
Similarly, a score of -1 means a low level of religious observance for each measure. 


Limitation 
One of our limitations is the dataset may not representative enough. For example, the source of religious affiliation is from research conducted in 2014 as this was the most recent dataset. Additionally, this dataset may not represent enough for each state of residents because the response rates from each state vary.
